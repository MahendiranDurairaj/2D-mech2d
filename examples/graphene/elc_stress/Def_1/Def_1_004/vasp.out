|  ADVICE TO THIS USER RUNNING 'VASP/VAMP'   (HEAR YOUR MASTER'S VOICE ...):  |
|                                                                             |
|      You have a (more or less) 'small supercell' and for smaller cells      |
|      it is recommended  to use the reciprocal-space projection scheme!      |
|      The real space optimization is not  efficient for small cells and it   |
|      is also less accurate ...                                              |
|      Therefore set LREAL=.FALSE. in the  INCAR file                         |
|                                                                             |
