# This is an exmple for Black phosphorene 
* To Test the program:

change the workdir variable in following files to your current directory

./elc_energy/Mech2D.json
./elc_stress/Mech2D.json
./ssc_stress/Mech2D.json

if your current work directory (get it by "pwd" command) is :

/home/zhangsan/mech2d/examples/alpha-P-R

then you set:
"workdir": "/home/zhangsan/mech2d/examples/alpha-P-R/elc_energy"

* To run the example from new

1. make sure that you have the right configure file "input.yaml"
2. sh run.sh
