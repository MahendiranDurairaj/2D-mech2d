Welcome to mech2d's documentation!
==================================
mech2d is a convenient script that use to calculate the mechanical properties of 2D 
materials, including Stress-Strain Curve, elastic constants and revalant properties. 

mech2d will generate the deformed structure according to the symmetry of structure 
and automatically submit the DFT task with error custodian. Once the DFT calculations
finished, mech2d can also be used to parsing the data and plot the figures.
